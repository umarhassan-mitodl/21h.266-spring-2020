Key Apartheid Legislation in South Africa 
------------------------------------------

What makes South Africa's apartheid era different to segregation and racial hatred that have occurred in other countries is the systematic way in which the National Party, which came into power in 1948, formalised it through the law. The main laws are described in the table below.

Narrowed the definition of the category of Blacks who had the right of permanent residence in towns.

Natives (Abolition of Passes and Coordination of Documents) Act, Act No. 67 of 1952
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
Commonly known as the Pass Laws, this ironically named act forced Black people to carry identification with them at all times. A pass included a photograph, details of place of origin, employment record, tax payments, and encounters with the police. It was a criminal offence to be unable to produce a pass when required to do so by the police. No Black person could leave a rural area for an urban one without a permit from the local authorities. On arrival in an urban area a permit to seek work had to be obtained within 72 hours.

Bantu Education Act, Act No. 47 of 1953
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
Established a Black Education Department in the Department of Native Affairs which would compile a curriculum that suited the "nature and requirements of the Black people". The author of the legislation, Dr Hendrik Verwoerd (then Minister of Native Affairs, later Prime Minister), stated that its aim was to prevent Africans receiving an education that would lead them to aspire to positions they wouldn't be allowed to hold in society. Instead Africans were to receive an education designed to provide them with skills to serve their own people in the homelands or to work in labouring jobs under Whites.

Various segregation laws were passed before the Nationalist Party took complete power in 1948. Probably the most significant were the Natives Land Act, No. 27 of 1913 and the Natives (Urban Areas) Act of 1923. The former made it illegal for Blacks to purchase or lease land from Whites except in reserves; this restricted Black occupancy to less than eight per cent of South Africa's land. The latter laid the foundations for residential segregation in urban areas.
